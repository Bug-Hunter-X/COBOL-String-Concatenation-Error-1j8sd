This example demonstrates an uncommon error in COBOL related to string concatenation.  The code attempts to combine a numeric variable with a literal string without proper type conversion, which can lead to unexpected results or compiler errors depending on the COBOL dialect.  The solution shows the correct approach to handle this using the appropriate string manipulation functions.
